      "\n",
      "**Debugging steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Check the length of the list or data structure: Use the `len()` function to verify that the list has at least the number of elements you are trying to access.\n",
      "2. Verify the indexing: Double-check that you are using the correct index (remember that indices start at 0 in Python).\n",
      "3. Use a debugger or print statements: Add print statements or use a debugger to inspect the values of variables and data structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example code fix:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose you have a list `my_list` and you're trying to access the 5th element:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",

      "except IndexError:\n",
      "    print(\"IndexError: Index out of bounds\")\n",
      "```\n",

      "\n",
      "* Use a valid index: `index = 2`\n",
      "* Add a bounds check: `if index < len(my_list): ...`\n",
